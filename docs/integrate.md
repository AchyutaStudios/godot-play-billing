# Integrate Play Billing

Before proceeding with the integration, please ensure that you have completed the following steps:

1. **Set Up Your Google Play Console Account:** Make sure your app is created and configured in the Google Play Console.
2. **Configure In-App Purchase Products:** Set up the required in-app purchase products in the Google Play Console, as these will be necessary for testing and implementing the billing functionality.

## Add PlayBilling Node to your scene

Once the plugin is enabled, the [PlayBilling](api-reference/play-billing.md) node will appear in the Node Hierarchy.

![Add PlayBilling Node](assets/add_play_billing.png)

Simply add the [PlayBilling](api-reference/play-billing.md) node to your scene to begin integrating Google Play Billing.


## Initialise

To get started, obtain a reference to the [PlayBilling](api-reference/play-billing.md) node:

```gdscript
@onready var _play_billing: PlayBilling = $PlayBilling
```

Use [start_connection](api-reference/play-billing.md#start_connection) to establish a connection to the Play Billing server:

```gdscript linenums="1"
@onready var _play_billing: PlayBilling = $PlayBilling

func _ready():
	_play_billing.start_connection()
```

### Connection Success

Upon a successful connection, the [PlayBilling](api-reference/play-billing.md) node emits a [connected](api-reference/play-billing.md#connected) signal.

After the connection is established, query the product details. **Important:** A product query must be completed successfully before calling [purchase](api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase) or [subscribe](api-reference/play-billing.md#subscribe); otherwise, they will return an error.

[query_product_details](api-reference/play-billing.md#query_product_details) function accepts two arguments:

1. Array of product IDs.
2. [ProductType](api-reference/play-billing.md#producttype) enum.

```gdscript
func _on_play_billing_connected() -> void:
    _play_billing.query_product_details(["product_ids"], PlayBilling.ProductType.INAPP)
```

### Connection Error

Upon failed connection, the [PlayBilling](api-reference/play-billing.md) node emits a `connect_error` signal. Use the `error_code` and `debug_message` for logging.

```gdscript
func _on_play_billing_connect_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message)
```


## Displaying Available Products

Once the product query is successful, the [product_details_query_completed](api-reference/play-billing.md#product_details_query_completed) signal is emitted. If the query fails, the [product_details_query_error](./api-reference/play-billing.md#product_details_query_error) signal is emitted instead.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _on_play_billing_product_details_query_completed(product_detail_list: Array[ProductDetail]) -> void:
	print(product_detail_list)


func _on_play_billing_product_details_query_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String, product_id_list: Array[String]) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message, product_id_list)
```

The signal emits list of [ProductDetail](api-reference/models/product-detail/index.md). Use the information provided in each [ProductDetail](api-reference/models/product-detail/index.md) to display relevant product information for users.


## Launch Purchase Flow


### Purchasing a Product

To launch purchase flow, use the [purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase) method. This method requires the `product_id` which is the unique identifier for the product.

```gdscript
_play_billing.purchase("product_id")
```

### Subscribing to a Product

To launch subscription flow, use the [subscribe](./api-reference/play-billing.md#subscribe) method. This method requires the `product_id` which is the unique identifier for the product, and an optional `offer_token`.

```gdscript
_play_billing.subscribe("product_id", "offer_token")
```

## Processing Purchased Items

After a succesfull [purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase) or [subscribe](./api-reference/play-billing.md#subscribe) call, the payment flow will emit the [purchases_updated](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchases_updated) signal. If payment flow fails [purchases_updated_error](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchases_updated_error) signal is emitted instead.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _on_play_billing_purchases_updated(purchases: Array[Purchase]) -> void:
	for purchase in purchases:
		_process_purchase(purchase)


func _on_play_billing_purchases_updated_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message)
```


### Acknowledge Products

Products need to be acknowledged to complete the billing cycle. Use the [acknowledge_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#acknowledge_purchase) method to acknowledge purchases.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _process_purchase(purchase: Purchase) -> void:
# Save purchase for future verification.
	if purchase.purchase_state == Purchase.PurchaseState.PURCHASED:
		if "product_id" in purchase.product_ids and !purchase.is_acknowledged:
			_play_billing.acknowledge_purchase(purchase.purchase_token)
```

Once a product is successfully acknowledged, the [purchase_acknowledged](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase_acknowledged) signal is emitted. If an error occurs, the [purhase_acknowledgement_error](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase_acknowledgement_error) signal is emitted instead.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _on_play_billing_purchase_acknowledged(purchase_token: String) -> void:
	# _purchase is the saved list of purchases.
	for purchase: Purchase in _purchases:
		if token == purchase.purchase_token:
			if "product_id" in purchase.product_ids:
				# Award item to user.


func _on_play_billing_purchase_acknowledgement_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String, purchase_token: String) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message, purchase_token)
```


### Consume Products

Consumable products, such as coins, can be purchased multiple times. To allow repeat purchases, consume the product after a successful purchase by calling [consume_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#consume_purchase).  This automatically acknowledges the purchase, enabling the user to buy the product again.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _process_purchase(purchase: Purchase) -> void:
	# Save purchase for future verification.
	if purchase.purchase_state == Purchase.PurchaseState.PURCHASED:
		if "product_id" in purchase.product_ids:
			_play_billing.consume_purchase(purchase.purchase_token)
```

Once a product is successfully consumed, the [purchase_consumed](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase_consumed) signal is emitted. If an error occurs, the [purhase_consumption_error](./api-reference/play-billing.md#purchase_consumption_error) signal is emitted instead.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _on_play_billing_purchase_consumed(purchase_token: String) -> void:
	# _purchase is the saved list of purchases.
	for purchase: Purchase in _purchases:
		if token == purchase.purchase_token:
			if "product_id" in purchase.product_ids:
				# Award product to user.


func _on_play_billing_purchase_consumption_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String, purchase_token: String) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message, purchase_token)
```
**Note**: Consumable products do not require a separate call to [acknowledge_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#acknowledge_purchase) method as, [consume_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#consume_purchase) automatically acknowledges them.


## Handling pending Purchases

Purchases can happen outside the app due to poor connection, pending transactions or various other reasons. It is necessary to handle such purchases. Call [query_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#query_purchase) method to query purchases. [query_purchase](./api-reference/play-billing.md#query_purchase) requires [ProductType](./api-reference/play-billing.md#producttype) argument. Generally you would like to query purchase after product details query is completed or when billing client is connected.

```gdscript
_play_billing.query_purchase(PlayBilling.ProductType.INAPP)
```

After successful query it emits [query_purchases_response](./api-reference/play-billing.md#query_purchases_response). If error occurs [query_purchase_error](./api-reference/play-billing.md#query_purchase_error) is emitted instead.

```gdscript linenums="1"
func _on_play_billing_query_purchases_response(purchase_list: Array[Purchase]) -> void:
	for purchase in purchase_list:
		_process_purchase(purchase)


func _on_play_billing_query_purchases_error(error_code: PlayBilling.BillingResponseCode, debug_message: String) -> void:
	print(error_code, debug_message)
```
